To run the script, follow these steps

1.  In tests_suite.py, include names of all .py files that contain tests in the tests_suite list.
2. Run main.py.  main.py picks up tests from all aforementioned .py files.
3. Check debuglog.txt for any debug information, including exception messages.
4. Check passfaillog.csv for pass-fail information of all tests.
5. All responses are dumped into .csv files inside the actuals folder.

To create a new test folder, follow these steps

1. Goto modules\tests folder
2. Create a new folder (say 'regression') that will contain all tests for that group.
3. Create a blank file called init.py within the folder
4. Create a subfolder within and name it 'actuals'.  This folder will contain all actual csv generated by running the tests
5. Create tests.py in the folder, to hold all tests in a dictionary.  Refer to any of the .py files within functional_tests folder, for a sample.
6. Add folder-path into the appropriate list in tests_suite.py.  For example, regression.tests
